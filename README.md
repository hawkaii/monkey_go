# Monkey Interpreter in Go

A Go implementation of the Monkey programming language, built by following Thorsten Ballâ€™s book [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/).

## Overview

This project is an educational interpreter for the Monkey language, developed step-by-step as described in Thorsten Ballâ€™s book. The goal is to learn about programming language design and interpreter implementation in Go.

Currently, the project covers the material from chapters 1â€“3 of the book:
- A fully functional lexer that tokenizes Monkey source code.
- A simple REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for interactive exploration.
- Recognition of basic language constructs: identifiers, integer literals, operators, delimiters, and keywords.

## Features

- **Lexer:** Tokenizes input into Monkey language tokens.
- **REPL:** Interactive shell to type Monkey statements and see their tokens.
- **Basic Token Support:** Identifiers, numbers, operators, delimiters, and keywords.
- **Error Handling:** Reports unknown or illegal tokens.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (version 1.18+ recommended)

### Building

Clone the repository and build the interpreter:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/hawkaii/monkey_go.git
cd monkey_go
go build -o monkey
```

### Running

Start the interactive REPL:
```sh
./monkey
```
Type Monkey language code and see the output!

## Project Structure

- `lexer/` â€” The Monkey lexer implementation.
- `token/` â€” Definitions for Monkey language tokens.
- `repl/` â€” The interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop.
- `main.go` â€” Entry point for the interpreter.

## Example

```text
>> let five = 5;
[LET] [IDENT] [ASSIGN] [INT] [SEMICOLON]
```
